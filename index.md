I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the MIT Operations Research Center, advised by [Rahul Mazumder](http://www.mit.edu/~rahulmaz/). I did an internship at IBM Research in 2020, working with [Yada Zhu](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-yzhu). Before coming to MIT, I did my master in Financial Engineering ([MSFE](https://msfe.ieor.columbia.edu/)) at the [IEOR department](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) where I had the pleasure to work with Professor [Donald Goldfarb](http://www.columbia.edu/~goldfarb/) and [Krzysztof Choromanski](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/krzysztof-choromanski). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/en/) from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
