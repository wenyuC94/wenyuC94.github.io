## Bio

Recently, I received my PhD degree in Operation Research from the [MIT](http://mit.edu/) [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), advised by [Rahul Mazumder](http://www.mit.edu/~rahulmaz/). I did an internship at IBM Research in 2020, working with [Yada Zhu](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-yzhu). Before coming to MIT, I did my master in Financial Engineering ([MSFE](https://msfe.ieor.columbia.edu/)) at the [IEOR department](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) where I had the pleasure to work with Professor [Donald Goldfarb](http://www.columbia.edu/~goldfarb/) and [Krzysztof Choromanski](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/krzysztof-choromanski). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/en/) from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 


## Research Interests

My research interests are in developing efficient computational methods for solving large-scale optimization problems in the fields of statistics, machine learning and operations research, with applications in finance, such as nonparametric estimation, sparse learning, covariance matrix estimation, event modeling, time series forecasting and portfolio optimization, etc. These problems involve either large-scale convex optimization or discrete optimization that is hard to scale using existing solvers.
